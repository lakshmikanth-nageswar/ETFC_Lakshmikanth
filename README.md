The Simulation of Furuta Pendulum can be done by generating the 3D trajectory plots programming in Python. The Dynamics of Furuta Pendulum are understood and derived by the reference mentioned in the files.

The Simulation can be done by generating the Trajectory of pendulum using 3D plots by MATPLOTLIB library or any other relevant libraries. 

This should be done by solving the dynamics of the system as mentioned (CONSIDERING THE VECTORIAL values in simulation) i.e., the trajectory of end effector of the pendulum should be plotted by evaluating the displacement (vector). The complete simulation can be visualised by considering the trajectory of several points on the pendulum. 

The position of End effector / Tip of Pendulum can be found out using the forward Dynamics/Kinematics of the system, by the vectorial positon we can generate the simulation. 

Pseudo code - 
1. Initialising all the system parameters.
2. Solving the dynamics of the system (obtaining the magnitudes of angular and linear parameters)
3. Finding the position of the required points on the pendulum to generate trajectory using Forward Kinematics / dynamics.
4. Generating Plots
