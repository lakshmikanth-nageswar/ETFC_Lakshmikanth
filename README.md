The Simulation of Furuta Pendulum can be done by generating the 3D trajectory plots. The Dynamics of Furuta Pendulum are understood and derived by the reference mentioned in the files.

The Simulation can be done by generating the Trajectory of pendulum using 3D plots by MATPLOTLIB library or any other relevant libraries.

This should be done by solving the dynamics of the system as mentioned (CONSIDERING THE VECTORIAL values in simulation) i.e., the trajectory of end effector of the pendulum should be plotted by evaluating the displacement (vector). The complete simulation can be visualised by considering the trajectory of several points on the pendulum.
